Radiologist Productivity:\n   - 23-37% reduction in average interpretation time for AI-assisted studies\n   - Equivalent to 2.1 additional FTE radiologist capacity at a 300-bed hospital\n   - Allows reallocation of resources to complex cases and multidisciplinary conferences\n\n2. Critical Finding Notification:\n   - 41% faster time to treatment for intracranial hemorrhage (Asan Medical Center, 2022)\n   - Reduces mortality risk in time-sensitive conditions\n   - Supports Joint Commission standards for critical result communication\n\n3. Quality & Consistency:\n   - 48% reduction in inter-reader variability for bone age assessments (Seoul National University Hospital, 2021)\n   - Supports standardized reporting for lung cancer screening programs (ACR Lung-RADS)\n   - Reduces callbacks and repeat imaging\n\nImplementation Model:\nPhased deployment starting with highest-volume modality (typically chest X-ray or head CT). Average time to full PACS integration: 4-6 weeks. Ongoing support includes quarterly performance reviews and model updates.\n\nWe can provide a customized ROI analysis based on your institution's case volume, payer mix, and strategic priorities. Would you like to schedule a discovery call with our clinical applications team?",
